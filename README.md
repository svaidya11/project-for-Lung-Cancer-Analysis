# project-for-Lung-Cancer-Analysis

Researchers are now using ML in applications such as EEG analysis and Cancer Detection/Analysis. For example, by examining biological data such as DNA methylation and RNA sequencing can then be possible to infer which genes can cause cancer and which genes can instead be able to suppress its expression.

In this project, we provide an overview of the main lung cancer prediction approaches proposed to date and highlight some of their relative strengths and weaknesses. We discuss some of the challenges in the development and validation of such techniques and outline the path to clinical adoption.

# Problem Statement :

The United States accounts for the loss of approximately 225,000 people each year due to lung cancer, with an added monetary loss of $12 billion dollars each year. The office of the Vice President allots a special concentration of effort in the direction of early detection of lung cancer, since this can increase survival rate of the victims. In accordance with Kaggle & ‘Booz, Allen, Hamilton’, they host a competition on Kaggle for detecting malignant blobs and nodules in the CT scans of patients by devising powerful machine learning algorithm. Being an interesting problem, providing a wide range of approaches for devising a solution, we (the team) decided to work on the Data Science Bowl 2017 problem.

Here, in this project I used  Logistic Regression & Decision Tree Classifier to Analysis the lung cancer.
