project-for-Lung-Cancer-Analysis

Researchers are now using ML in applications such as EEG analysis and Cancer Detection/Analysis. For example, by examining biological data such as DNA methylation and RNA sequencing can then be possible to infer which genes can cause cancer and which genes can instead be able to suppress its expression.

In this project, we provide an overview of the main lung cancer prediction approaches proposed to date and highlight some of their relative strengths and weaknesses. We discuss some of the challenges in the development and validation of such techniques and outline the path to clinical adoption.
